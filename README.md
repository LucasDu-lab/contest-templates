# Contest Templates

A collection of useful C++ templates for competitive programming and algorithmic contests. This repository aims to provide a solid foundation for solving common problems efficiently.

## Features

- **Data Structures**: Implementations of essential data structures such as:
  - Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find)
  - Matrices

- **Algorithms**: Common algorithms for various problem-solving scenarios, including:
  - Extended Euclidean Algorithm (exgcd)
  - Algorithms for Prime Factorization and sieve algorithms
  - Gaussion Elimination

- **Utilities**: Handy utility functions for:
  - Input/Output operations for int128
  - BigInteger operations
  - Modular operations
  - Fast IO

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- A C++ integrated development environment (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, Sublime Text, etc.)
- CMake for building the project (optional)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LucasDu-lab/contest-templates.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
    ```bash
    cd contest-templates
    ```
## Usage
Include headers like this:
```cpp
#include "int128.h" //the header file name
//the rest of the code
```
Refer to the documentation and individual header files for more information.
